# 📊 Financial Performance Analysis

**SQL • Excel • Business Insights**

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project showcases a **real-world financial performance analysis** using **SQL and Excel** to evaluate how **revenue, expenses, profit, and profit margins** evolve across quarterly periods.

The focus is not just on calculations, but on **turning financial data into insights that decision-makers can understand and act on**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To demonstrate how a data analyst:

* structures financial data,
* applies SQL logic for accurate calculations, and
* presents results in a **clear, stakeholder-ready format**.

---

## ❓ Business Questions Answered

* How does **revenue vs expenses** change quarter-by-quarter?
* Which quarters generate **stronger profits and margins**?
* Are expenses growing **in line with revenue**?
* What high-level signals indicate **financial stability or risk**?

---

## 🗂 Data Overview

The analysis is based on two financial datasets:

* **Income data** – actual revenue values recorded by date
* **Expense data** – actual expense values recorded by date

For clarity and comparability, data is **aggregated at a quarterly level**.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **SQL (Azure SQL / T-SQL)** – data preparation, aggregation, and calculations
* **Excel** – tables, charts, and insight summaries

---

## ⚙️ Analysis Approach

1. Loaded raw income and expense data into a SQL database
2. Standardised date fields for time-based analysis
3. Grouped transactions by **quarter**
4. Calculated core financial metrics:

   * Total Revenue
   * Total Expenses
   * Profit
   * Profit Margin (%)
5. Exported results to Excel for visualisation and interpretation

---

## 📈 Key Insights (Executive Summary)

* **Profit margins remain stable** across quarters, indicating controlled cost management
* **Revenue fluctuations directly influence profit**, while expenses stay relatively consistent
* Overall trends suggest **financial consistency rather than volatility**

These insights help stakeholders quickly assess **financial health and cost discipline**.

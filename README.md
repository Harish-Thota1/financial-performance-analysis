# Financial Performance Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **business-focused financial analysis** using SQL and Excel to understand how **revenue, expenses, profit, and profit margins** change across quarterly periods.

The aim is to show how raw financial data can be transformed into **clear insights and visuals** that support decision-making by stakeholders.

---

## What This Project Shows

* How financial data is analysed using **SQL**
* How insights are presented clearly using **Excel**
* How numbers are converted into **charts, tables, and conclusions**
* How an analyst communicates results in a **stakeholder-friendly way**

---

## Key Business Questions Answered

* How do revenue and expenses trend across quarters?
* Which quarters perform better in terms of profit and margin?
* Are costs controlled relative to revenue growth?
* What high-level insights matter most to decision-makers?

---

## Data Used

The analysis is based on two financial datasets:

* **Income data** – records actual revenue by date
* **Expense data** – records actual expenses by date

The data is aggregated at a **quarterly level** to make trends easy to understand.

---

## Tools Used

* **SQL (Azure SQL / T-SQL)** – to calculate financial metrics
* **Excel** – to create tables, charts, and insights
* **GitHub** – to document and share the analysis

---

## How the Analysis Was Done

1. Financial data was loaded into a SQL database
2. Revenue and expenses were grouped by **quarter**
3. Key metrics were calculated:

   * Total Revenue
   * Total Expenses
   * Profit
   * Profit Margin (%)
4. Results were exported to Excel
5. Charts and summaries were created for easy interpretation

---

## Key Insights (Summary)

* Profit margins remain relatively stable across quarters
* Revenue changes directly influence profit, but expenses stay controlled
* Overall financial performance shows consistency rather than volatility

These insights help stakeholders quickly assess **financial health and cost management**.

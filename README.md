**SQL • Excel • Business Insights**

---

## 🔍 Executive Overview

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end financial performance analysis** using SQL and Excel, focused on evaluating **revenue, expenses, profit, and profit margins across quarterly periods**.

The emphasis is not only on accurate calculations, but on **translating financial data into insights that decision-makers can quickly understand and act on**.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

To showcase how a data analyst:

* Structures raw financial data
* Applies SQL logic to compute reliable financial metrics
* Presents results in a **stakeholder-ready, decision-focused format**

---

## ❓ Key Business Questions

* How do **revenue and expenses** trend quarter-by-quarter?
* Which quarters deliver **stronger profitability and margins**?
* Are expenses being controlled relative to revenue growth?
* What signals indicate **financial stability vs potential risk**?

---

## 🗂 Data Overview

The analysis is built on two datasets:

* **Income Data** – Actual revenue values recorded by date
* **Expense Data** – Actual expense values recorded by date

For clarity and comparability, all values are **aggregated at a quarterly level**.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **SQL (Azure SQL / T-SQL)** – data preparation, aggregation, and calculations
* **Excel** – summary tables, charts, and insight communication

---

## ⚙️ Analysis Methodology

1. Loaded raw income and expense data into a SQL database
2. Standardised date fields for time-based analysis
3. Grouped transactions by **quarter**
4. Calculated core financial metrics:

   * Total Revenue
   * Total Expenses
   * Profit
   * Profit Margin (%)
5. Exported results to Excel for visualisation and interpretation

---

## 📈 Executive Insights

* **Profit margins remain stable across quarters**, indicating disciplined cost control
* **Revenue fluctuations directly impact profit**, while expenses remain relatively consistent
* Overall trends reflect **financial consistency rather than volatility**

These insights enable stakeholders to quickly assess **financial health and cost management effectiveness**.
